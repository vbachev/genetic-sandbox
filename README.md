Genetic Sandbox
======

This is a playground I use to practice OOP in JS.
The project itself revolves around an idea I had to simulate living cells, gene and trait inheritance, genetic mutations. It's a work in progress and needs more love but it's slowly getting better :)

### It goes like this: ###
* cells are represented using a class that tracks a cell's life stats (food, health, energy etc.) and manages it's inner processes (feeding, growth, reproduction etc.)
* cells exchange information and substances with the environment (for instance they take food to eat) altering it little by little
* cell inner processes are modified by the presence of genes (key-value pairs). Genes get inherited when a cell divides
* when certain conditions are met a cell may divide creating two new cells that inherit half of their parent's stats and slightly modified gene set (genes mutate during cell division)
* gradual mutations in genes create huge amount ot variety in cell behaviour increasing or decreasing survival chances - thus we have our own little evolution to play with :)

### What's to come: ###
* genes that modify cell inner processes are done. next step is genes that enable new behaviour like creating food, hunting other cells for food, movement
* genes may help cells develop new structures to help them like sensors to detect and navigate in the environment
* environment now has only basic properties (food and heat) but I plan to make it more complex (2d coordinates to enable movement; humidity, toxins and other factors to affect lifeforms and others ...)
